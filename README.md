# terraform-training-jamfpro

This repository serves as a **terraform training repository** for workplace engineers new to using terraform for management of Jamf Pro instances. The content within this repo aims to provide a learning path taking someone with little to no experience on a journey whereby at the end, the engineer feels empowered to use DevOps tools and practises within their team at a profient level.

This training does not seek to reinvent the wheel, so where it's senisble links will be provided to other publically available training materials. However, using DevOps practises with workplace teams is a relatively new concept and there are distinctions between IaC (infrastructure as code) and CaC (configuration-as-code) using IaC principles. To that end, rather than direct people to training that IaC targetted, this repo will house material, exercises and hackathons relevant to the workplace domain and it's nuances.

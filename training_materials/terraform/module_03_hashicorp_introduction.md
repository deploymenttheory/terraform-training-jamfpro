#### 🔷 What is Terraform?

**Terraform** is an **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tool that allows you to **build, change, and version infrastructure** safely and efficiently.

**🎯 Core Purpose:**
- **Provision** infrastructure resources across multiple providers
- **Manage** the complete lifecycle of infrastructure
- **Version control** infrastructure changes
- **Collaborate** on infrastructure development

**🔑 Key Characteristics:**

- **☁️ Cloud Agnostic**: Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, and 5000+ providers
- **📋 Declarative**: You describe what you want, not how to get it
- **🔄 Idempotent**: Same configuration = same result every time
- **📊 State Management**: Tracks what resources exist and their configuration
- **🗺️ Execution Planning**: Shows what will change before making changes

#### 🔄 Terraform vs Traditional Infrastructure Management

**❌ Traditional Approach:**
```bash
# Manual AWS Console clicks or CLI commands
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-12345 --instance-type t2.micro
aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name web-sg
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-name web-sg --protocol tcp --port 80
# ... many more commands
# No easy way to track what was created or replicate it
```

**✅ Terraform Approach:**
```hcl
# Single configuration file describes entire infrastructure
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  
  vpc_security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.web.id]
  
  tags = {
    Name = "WebServer"
  }
}

resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  name = "web-sg"
  
  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}
```

#### ☁️ Terraform Deployment Options

**🆓 Terraform Open Source (OSS)**
- Free to use
- Run locally or in CI/CD
- Manual state management
- Individual or small team usage

**☁️ Terraform Cloud**
- SaaS offering by HashiCorp
- Remote state management
- Team collaboration features
- Policy enforcement
- Private module registry

**🏢 Terraform Enterprise**
- Self-hosted version of Terraform Cloud
- Enterprise security and compliance
- Air-gapped environments
- Advanced governance features

#### 🌍 Multi-Cloud Capabilities

**🎯 Why Multi-Cloud Matters:**
- **🛡️ Avoid vendor lock-in**: Don't put all eggs in one basket
- **🌐 Geographic distribution**: Use best regions from different providers
- **💰 Cost optimization**: Leverage competitive pricing
- **🔄 Disaster recovery**: Failover between providers
- **🎯 Best-of-breed**: Use each provider's strongest services

**Example Multi-Cloud Setup:**
```hcl
# AWS Provider for compute
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Azure Provider for databases  
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

# Google Cloud for ML services
provider "google" {
  project = "my-project"
  region  = "us-central1"
}

# Create resources across all three clouds
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-12345"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "azurerm_mysql_server" "database" {
  name                = "mydb-server"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.main.name
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.main.location
  # ... configuration
}

resource "google_ml_engine_model" "ml_model" {
  name = "my_ml_model"
  # ... configuration
}
```

### 💻 **Exercise 2.1**: Terraform Installation Verification
**Duration**: 15 minutes

Let's verify your Terraform installation and explore basic commands.

**Step 1: Verify Installation**
```bash
# Open VS Code terminal (Ctrl+` or Cmd+`)
terraform version

# Expected output:
# Terraform v1.6.0
# on darwin_amd64 (or your platform)
```

**Step 2: Explore Help System**
```bash
# Get general help
terraform --help

# Get help for specific commands
terraform plan --help
terraform apply --help
terraform destroy --help
```

**Step 3: Create Your First Terraform Directory**
```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir ~/terraform-learning
cd ~/terraform-learning

# Open in VS Code
code .
```

**Step 4: Create a Simple Configuration**

Create a file called `main.tf` in VS Code:
```hcl
# This is a comment in HCL
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"
  
  required_providers {
    local = {
      source  = "hashicorp/local"
      version = "~> 2.0"
    }
  }
}

# Create a local file - no cloud provider needed!
resource "local_file" "hello" {
  filename = "hello.txt"
  content  = "Hello from Terraform! 🚀"
}

# Output the file content
output "file_content" {
  value = local_file.hello.content
}
```

**Step 5: Initialize and Apply**
```bash
# Initialize Terraform (downloads providers)
terraform init

# Plan the changes
terraform plan

# Apply the changes
terraform apply
# Type 'yes' when prompted

# Verify the file was created
ls -la
cat hello.txt
```

**Step 6: Explore State**
```bash
# View current state
terraform show

# List resources in state
terraform state list
```

**Step 7: Clean Up**
```bash
# Destroy resources
terraform destroy
# Type 'yes' when prompted

# Verify file was deleted
ls -la
```

💡 **Pro Tip**: Notice how Terraform tracks what it created in the state file and can cleanly remove it!

## Overview

When managing Jamf Pro with Terraform, you‚Äôll often start with existing configurations already in your Jamf instance ‚Äî things like policies, scripts, or smart groups.  
Instead of recreating these manually in code, Terraform allows you to **import** existing resources into your state.

---

## 1. What Is the Terraform Import Feature?

Terraform keeps track of resources it manages in a **state file** (`terraform.tfstate`).  
If a resource exists in Jamf Pro but not in that state file, Terraform doesn‚Äôt know it exists ‚Äî until you import it.

The import process connects an **existing real-world resource** (e.g., a Jamf Policy) with a **Terraform resource block** in your configuration.

### Before Import

Terraform plan output:

```
# jamfpro_policy.my_policy will be created
```

Terraform doesn‚Äôt know the policy already exists in Jamf Pro.

### After Import

Terraform understands the resource exists and manages it going forward.

---

## 2. The Two Ways to Import

Terraform provides **two ways** to perform imports:

### A. Using the `terraform import` Command (Classic Method)

This is the traditional way to import existing infrastructure.

#### Syntax

```bash
terraform import <RESOURCE_ADDRESS> <EXTERNAL_ID>
```

**The Resource Address** is in the following syntax: `resourceType.resourceName`. The resource address `jamfpro_policy.gordons_policy` would have the following resource:

```hcl
resource "jamfpro_policy" "gordons_policy" {
  name = "Gordons example policy"

  # ... additional configuration ...
}
```

**The external ID** will be the ID of the resource. In the example of Jamf Pro, this would be the ID of each resource, i.e. the Policy ID (found in the URL).

#### Example (Jamf Pro Policy)

```bash
terraform import jamfpro_policy.login_window_policy 42
```

Where:

- `jamfpro_policy` ‚Üí The Terraform resource type.
- `login_window_policy` ‚Üí The local name in your configuration.
- `42` ‚Üí The Jamf Pro policy ID (found in the Jamf Pro URL or API).

After import, Terraform writes this mapping to your state file.

#### Steps to import

1. Write a basic resource block (empty or partial) in your `.tf` file:
   ```hcl
   resource "jamfpro_policy" "login_window_policy" {}
   ```
2. Run the import command with the ID.
3. Run `terraform plan` to verify.
4. Run `terraform show` to inspect imported attributes.

> üìù **Note:** The configuration file won‚Äôt be automatically populated ‚Äî you‚Äôll need to update it manually or use the `terraform show -json` output to help build it.

---

### B. Using the `import` Block (Declarative Method)

Introduced in **Terraform v1.5**, the `import` block allows you to declare imports as part of your Terraform configuration ‚Äî making them **repeatable and documented**.

#### Example

```hcl
import {
  to = jamfpro_policy.login_window_policy
  id = "42"
}
```

#### Benefits

- Keeps imports in version control.
- Reusable across environments.
- Integrates with Terraform Cloud and CI/CD pipelines.
- Enables `terraform plan` to preview imports before applying.

#### Steps

1. Define your resource and import block:

   ```hcl
   resource "jamfpro_policy" "login_window_policy" {}

   import {
     to = jamfpro_policy.login_window_policy
     id = "42"
   }
   ```

2. Run:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```
3. Terraform will add the resource to your state just like the CLI method.

---

## 3. Verification and Troubleshooting

After importing, check your resource:

```bash
terraform state list
terraform state show jamfpro_policy.login_window_policy
```

If Terraform shows the correct attributes, the import was successful.

**Common issues:**
| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Resource not found | Wrong ID | Check the Jamf Pro API ID or URL |
| Resource arguments mismatch | Schema differences | Adjust your `.tf` configuration |
| Import doesn‚Äôt show attributes | Empty resource block | Run `terraform show` and update the `.tf` file manually |

## 4. Exercises

### üß† Exercise 1: Import an Existing Jamf Script

1. Log in to your Jamf Pro dashboard.
2. Find a script you‚Äôve already uploaded.  
   Note its **ID** from the URL (e.g., `/scripts.html?id=23`).
3. In your Terraform config:
   ```hcl
   resource "jamfpro_script" "login_script" {}
   ```
4. Run:
   ```bash
   terraform import jamfpro_script.login_script 23
   ```
5. Verify with:
   ```bash
   terraform state show jamfpro_script.login_script
   ```
6. Update the `.tf` file with attributes from `terraform show`.

---

### üß† Exercise 2: Use the Import Block

1. Find another resource that is already in the Jamf Pro tenant.
2. Add this to your `.tf` file:
   ```hcl
   import {
     to = jamfpro_script.login_script # Or another resource
     id = "23" # Or another ID
   }
   ```
3. Run `terraform plan` and confirm Terraform plans to import.
4. Run `terraform apply`.
5. Verify using:
   ```bash
   terraform state list
   ```
6. üéâ You‚Äôve now declared an import declaratively!

---

### üß† Bonus Exercise: Compare CLI vs Import Block

1. Import one resource with the CLI.
2. Import another using an `import` block.
3. Discuss:
   - Which method fits better for CI/CD pipelines?
   - Which provides better documentation?
   - What happens if you remove the import block later?

---

## 5. Key Takeaways

- **`terraform import`** (CLI) ‚Üí Quick one-time import.
- **`import` block** ‚Üí Declarative, reusable, and version-controlled.
- Both link existing Jamf Pro resources with Terraform state.
- Always verify imports and update your `.tf` configuration for accuracy.

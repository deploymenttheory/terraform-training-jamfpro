# 🧠 Hackday: Jamf Pro → Terraform Migration

**Success Criteria & Scoring Guide**

## 🧮 Scoring Criteria

| Category                    | Weight | Description                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Implementation Quality      | 25%    | Well-structured, readable, and logically organized Terraform code.                          |
| Completeness                | 20%    | How much of the target Jamf Pro environment is represented.                                 |
| Scalability                 | 15%    | Use of loops (for_each, count), modules, and DRY principles for reusability.                |
| Readability & Documentation | 15%    | Terraform is documentation. Code should be self-explaining, consistent, and well-commented. |
| Dynamic Design              | 10%    | Demonstrate automation and flexibility — parameterization, variable usage, etc.             |
| Plan Accuracy               | 15%    | Running terraform plan results in no diff once the migration is complete.                   |

> [!NOTE]
> ⚖️ A “clean and complete” implementation will always score higher than one that is fast but messy.
